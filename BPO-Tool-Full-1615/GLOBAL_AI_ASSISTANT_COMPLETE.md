# Global AI Assistant - Implementation Complete ✅

## Executive Summary

The AI Support Assistant is now **globally available on every module and the homepage** as a floating, context-aware copilot that follows users throughout their entire workflow.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Global Floating AI Assistant Component ✅

**File**: `src/components/GlobalAIAssistant.tsx`

A sophisticated floating assistant that:
- **Floats in bottom-right corner** - Always accessible, never intrusive
- **Context-aware** - Knows which module the user is viewing
- **Persists across navigation** - Conversation continues as you move between modules
- **Minimize/Expand states** - Can be minimized to a button or expanded to fullscreen
- **Unread indicator** - Shows red pulse when new messages arrive while minimized
- **Smooth animations** - Professional transitions between states

---

### 2. Context-Aware Intelligence ✅

The assistant adapts its suggestions based on the current module:

#### Dashboard
- "Show me critical alerts"
- "What are the pending approvals?"
- "Show ticket trends"
- "Display CSAT scores"

#### Contact Center
- "How do I create a new ticket?"
- "Show me my open tickets"
- "What are the ticket priorities?"
- "How do I assign tickets?"

#### Complaints Management
- "How do I file a complaint?"
- "Show me critical complaints"
- "What is the escalation process?"
- "How do I resolve complaints?"

#### Process Mapping
- "How do I create a new process?"
- "Show me all active processes"
- "Find processes related to onboarding"
- "Explain BPMN notation"

#### Knowledge Base
- "How do I create an article?"
- "Search for training materials"
- "Show me SOPs"
- "Find troubleshooting guides"

#### Workforce Management
- "How do I create a schedule?"
- "Show me team capacity"
- "Explain shift management"
- "How do I request time off?"

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);           // Open/closed state
const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);   // Expanded mode
const [hasUnread, setHasUnread] = useState(false);     // Unread indicator
const [conversationId, setConversationId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([]); // Chat history
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Conversations stored with context
support_conversations {
  id: uuid
  user_id: uuid
  conversation_type: text
  conversation_title: text
  context_module: text          -- NEW: Tracks module context
  created_at: timestamptz
  last_message_at: timestamptz
}

-- Messages track context too
support_messages {
  id: uuid
  conversation_id: uuid
  message_type: text
  message_content: text
  sender_type: text
  context_module: text          -- NEW: Tracks where message was sent
  referenced_items: jsonb
  created_at: timestamptz
}
```

### AI Response Generation
```typescript
// Context passed to AI for better responses
const { data: response } = await supabase.rpc('generate_ai_response', {
  p_user_message: inputMessage,
  p_conversation_id: conversationId,
  p_context_module: currentModule  // NEW: Context awareness
});
```
