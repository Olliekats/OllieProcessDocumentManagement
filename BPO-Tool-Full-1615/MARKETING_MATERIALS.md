## Email 1: Subject: "Your BPO is leaving $168K on the table"

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much money is your BPO losing to inefficiencies you can't see?

Most operations directors think they're running efficiently. Then they see our AI process discovery.

In the first 30 days, it typically finds:
- $40K+ in hidden process waste
- 3-5 critical bottlenecks
- 8-12 optimization opportunities
- Dozens of automation candidates

Total? An average of $168K in annual savings.

Want to see what we'd find in YOUR operation?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. The discovery session is free. The insights are priceless.

## Email 2: Subject: "This agent is going to quit (you just don't know it yet)"

[Name],

One of your best agents is about to quit.

How do I know? Because it happens to every BPO. High performers burn out. You find out in their exit interview.

What if you knew 3 months before?

Our ML-powered burnout prediction analyzes:
- Workload trends
- Performance patterns
- Engagement signals
- Behavioral changes

And predicts attrition risk with 87% accuracy.

Three months ahead.

Time enough to fix it. Time enough to save them.

The average cost of turnover? $15K per agent.
Our platform cost? Less than one prevented exit.

## Email 3: Subject: "What if you could test every change before making it?"

[Name],

You're about to add 2 agents. $200K annual investment.

Will it work? Probably. Maybe. You hope?

What if you could KNOW?

Our Process Simulation Engine runs Monte Carlo simulations:
- 1000 iterations in seconds
- 88-95% confidence intervals
- Exact cost/benefit analysis
- Risk assessment included

Test before you invest.
Know before you commit.
Succeed instead of guess.
